## Meet Me
Good day. I'm Ehi. I'm an aspiring developer from Edo, Nigeria. I took this challenge. Here's how I did it and thanks for reading!

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

I know, It doesn't match it very much, or even at all. I gave it my all though.

## My process
I started this one by opening the design images in GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). I measure the paddings, gutters (gaps) and sizes of responsive elements. These help me create responsive functions and mixins. Then, I write my HTML, and give class names using BEM which I recently learned. I use SCSS to create my styling so BEM makes it easier.

After my HTML, I start styling with padding. I set the margin of all elements to zero and then give all elements borders. This helps me visualize all element boundaries - all this I do without adding any color.

Then, I add color, backgrounds and border radii to the assigned elements. I prefer using Comic Sans MS and or Outfit as my font because they feel relaxing to my eyes and help me think better. I can't explain it though, it's just a feeling.

Weird, right?üòÅ

After that, I modularize my "sassy sheets" and them link them all to a single file to be compiled. I learnt this from Jessie Chan's (Coder Coder on Youtube) video on how to organise SCSS files into files to be more effective and simple. Here's how I modularized this one.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- **No Javascript**

### What I learned

The mobile navigation without JavaScript was awesome. I learned how to do it from **Coding2Go** on YouTube. He's really good at explaining front-end stuff.

Here's the HTML. The labels all target the single input element. One for the hamburger, one for the close-icon, and one for the semi-transparent-opacified layer that appers when the navigation is open in mobile. Try the site to see what I mean. Its so good to be able to do this with CSS and it is responsive and animatable.

```html
<header>
  <img src="./assets/images/logo.svg" alt="logo" class="logo" />
  <label for="nav-checkbox"><img src="./assets/images/icon-menu.svg" alt="icon-menu" class="icon-menu-open"/></label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="nav-checkbox" />
  <label for="nav-checkbox" class="overlay"></label>
  <nav>
    <label for="nav-checkbox"><img src="./assets/images/icon-menu-close.svg" alt="icon-menu-close" class="icon-menu-close"/></label>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">New</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Popular</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Trending</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Categories</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

```scss
header {
  @include m.df(space-between, center);
  
  input {
    display: none;
  }
  img.logo, .icon-menu-open {
    width: auto;
  }
  img.logo {
    width: clamp(3rem, 5dvw, 4rem);
  }
  nav {
    transition: all .75s;
    padding: 20px;
    @include m.df(normal, normal, column, 70px);
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    right: -100%;
    width: 60dvw;
    background-color: #fff;
    z-index: 10;
  
    label {
      @include m.df(right, center);
      & img {
        width: auto;
        align-self: flex-end;
      }
    }

    ul {
      @include m.df(normal, start, column, 20px);
      list-style: none;
      li {
        a {
          text-decoration: none;
          color: c.$very-dark-blue;
          font-size: 18px;
        }
      }
    }
  
  }
  input:checked ~ nav{
    right: 0;
  }
  .overlay {
    position: fixed;
    right: -100%;
    transition: all .75s;
  }
  input:checked ~ .overlay {
    z-index: 9;
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    width: 100dvw;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    background: rgba(0,0,0,.3);
  }


  @media (min-width: l.$tab) {
    input, label, .overlay {
      display: none;
    }
    nav {
      position: static;
      padding: 0;
      gap: 0;
      & label {
        display:none;
      }
      & ul {
        @include m.df(right, start,  row, 2rem);
        li {
          a {
            color: c.$grayish-blue;
            font-size: 1rem;
            transition: all .3s;
            &:hover {
              color: c.$soft-red;
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Yep. NO JavaScript**. This is definitely an upgrade for me.


### Continued development

It looked like every element in the desktop design snaps to a certain defined position in a grid defined for it. I already tried that approach to the extent I use subgrid to make clild elements inherit their parent's grid properties but it broke my design and my heart.üíî

I would love to get this design perfect one day. Any help with this please chat me up or just reply to my solution.

- [Jessie Chan's "How I organise my SASS projects"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQsjNmkqUOc&list=PPSV) - This helped me creat a quite wonderful folder structure. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Coding2Go's "Create a Responsize navbar - a CSS only solution"](https://youtu.be/8eFeIFKAKHw?si=GzljC16g9cEAOXLY) - This is an amazing video that I'll recommend to all out there who want to use only CSS to create nav-bars and make their lives simpler.
